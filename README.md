# Javascript Calculator

This is a react app for the javascript calculator project from the Front End Development Libraries Projects on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

You can view this project on my GitHub pages: https://duncan-s-white.github.io/javascript-calculator/

This project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
It was my first time using the most current syntax for React in the form of functional components and React hooks.

Some dependencies used:
 - fortawesome - for icons
 - gh-pages - to build and deploy to GitHub pages

## How to run locally

Clone the project to your machine. In the project directory, run the command:

`npm start`
